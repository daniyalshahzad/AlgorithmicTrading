# Algorithmic Trading
Algorithmic Trading using IBKR API based on NLP and Historical Data (On-going Project)

This project leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and historical market data to identify short-lived opportunities in financial markets. The focus is on combining news sentiment embeddings, historical price movements, and technical indicators to detect arbitrage windows or market inefficiencies that typically close quickly.

Note: Stock price prediction is not the primary goal, as market dynamics are highly complex and unpredictable. Instead, the system emphasizes detecting conditions that suggest short-term imbalances or inefficiencies.
